# FYS5419-FYS5429_report2
Codes and report for the joint second project in FYS5419 and FYS5429 at UiO.

In the RBM folder, the codes used to model the MNIST dataset using restricted Boltzmann machines can be found.
Similarly, in VarQBM, one can find the codes used to analyze the VarQBM algorithm. This is almost the same as the codes fund in https://github.com/leevilehtonen/tfq-varqbm/tree/main, the repository from Leevi Lehtonen's Master's degree, only slightly modified for plotting purposes.

In both, the main procedure is detailed in the ipynb file, while the other files are usually functions or classes imported in this main notebook.
